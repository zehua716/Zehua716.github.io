All theoretical content is based on course notes, initially handwritten during class and later converted into electronic versions, with further translations and explanations added. As such, I claim only the labor involved, while all academic achievements belong to the supervising instructors. Each article includes acknowledgments of the supervising instructor and their personal website (if available).



All practical content consists of the Chinese versions of post-lab reports. The theoretical and coding aspects were primarily completed by me.
